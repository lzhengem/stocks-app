Nasdaq recommends 12 steps to analyze if a stock is worth to buy: http://www.nasdaq.com/investing/dozen/

Ranking Stocks based on these 12 criteria, stocks that have 9+ 'passing scores' are strong stocks to buy,
whereas stocks with 5 or less are not.

However, there is no easy way to check at a glance if the stock you are looking at passes these tests.

This project systematically scrapes the information from Nasdaq's website for each of the stocks they have listed,
compares each stock's attributes to Nasdaq's recomendation, and list the stocks with the highest potential on top.

Currently, only 9 of the criteria are being monitored.
